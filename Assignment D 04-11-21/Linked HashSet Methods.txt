LinkedHashSet:
-Java LinkedHashSet class is a Hashtable and Linked list implementation of the set interface. It inherits HashSet class 
 and implements Set interface.
-The important points about Java LinkedHashSet class are:

 Java LinkedHashSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
 Java LinkedHashSet class provides all optional set operation and permits null elements.
 Java LinkedHashSet class is non synchronized.
 Java LinkedHashSet class maintains insertion order.
LinkedHashSet Method:
1)HashSet()
 It is used to construct a default HashSet.
2)HashSet(Collection c)
 It is used to initialize the hash set by using the elements of the collection c.
3)LinkedHashSet(int capacity)
  It is used initialize the capacity of the linked hash set to the given integer value capacity.
4)LinkedHashSet(int capacity, float fillRatio)
  It is used to initialize both the capacity and the fill ratio (also called load capacity) of the hash set from its argument.
