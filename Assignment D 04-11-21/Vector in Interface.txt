Vector in Interface:
-Vector implements List Interface. Like ArrayList it also maintains insertion order but it is rarely used in non-thread environment as it 
  is synchronized and due to which it gives poor performance in searching, adding, delete and update of its elements.
-Three ways to create vector class object:
 1)Vector vec = new Vector();
 2)Vector object= new Vector(int initialCapacity 
 3)Vector object= new vector(int initialcapacity, capacityIncrement)
-Commonally used vector in class
  void addElement(Object element): It inserts the element at the end of the Vector.
  int capacity(): This method returns the current capacity of the vector.
  int size(): It returns the current size of the vector.
  void setSize(int size): It changes the existing size with the specified size.
  boolean contains(Object element): This method checks whether the specified element is present in the Vector. If the element is been found it returns true else false.
  boolean containsAll(Collection c): It returns true if all the elements of collection c are present in the Vector.
  Object elementAt(int index): It returns the element present at the specified location in Vector.
  Object firstElement(): It is used for getting the first element of the vector.
  Object lastElement(): Returns the last element of the array.
  Object get(int index): Returns the element at the specified index.
  boolean isEmpty(): This method returns true if Vector doesnâ€™t have any element.
  boolean removeElement(Object element): Removes the specifed element from vector.
  boolean removeAll(Collection c): It Removes all those elements from vector which are present in the Collection c.
  void setElementAt(Object element, int index): It updates the element of specifed index with the given element.
