HashSet Method:
-Java HashSet class is used to create a collection that uses a hash table for storage. It inherits the AbstractSet class and 
 implements Set interface.
-The important points about Java HashSet class are:

-HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing.
-HashSet contains unique elements only.
-HashSet allows null value.
-HashSet class is non synchronized.
-HashSet doesn't maintain the insertion order. Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their hashcode.
-HashSet is the best approach for search operations
1)add(E e)
   It is used to add the specified element to this set if it is not already present.
2)clear()
  It is used to remove all of the elements from the set.
3)clone()
  It is used to return a shallow copy of this HashSet instance: the elements themselves are not cloned.
4)contains(Object o)
  It is used to return true if this set contains the specified element.
5)isEmpty()
   It is used to return true if this set contains no elements.
6)iterator()
  It is used to return an iterator over the elements in this set.
7)remove(Object o)
  It is used to remove the specified element from this set if it is present.
8)size()
  It is used to return the number of elements in the set.
9)spliterator()
  It is used to create a late-binding and fail-fast Spliterator over the elements in the set.
