Priority Queue:
-The PriorityQueue class provides the facility of using queue. But it does not orders the elements in FIFO manner. 
-It inherits AbstractQueue class.
-PriorityQueue class declaration
                               public class PriorityQueue<E> extends AbstractQueue<E> implements Serializable
-In order to create a priority queue, we must import the java.util.PriorityQueue package. Once we import the package, here is how we can 
  create a priority queue in Java.
-Here, we have created a priority queue without any arguments. In this case, the head of the priority queue is the smallest element of the 
 queue. And elements are removed in ascending order from the queue.
Methods of PriorityQueue
        1)add() - Inserts the specified element to the queue. If the queue is full, it throws an exception.
        2)offer() - Inserts the specified element to the queue. If the queue is full, it returns false.
        3) remove() - removes the specified element from the queue
        4) poll() - returns and removes the head of the queue
-Here, we have created a priority queue named numbers. We have inserted 4 and 2 to the queue.
-To access elements from a priority queue, we can use the peek() method. This method returns the head of the queue. 
-To iterate over the elements of a priority queue, we can use the iterator() method. In order to use this method, we must 
 import the java.util.Iterator package.
