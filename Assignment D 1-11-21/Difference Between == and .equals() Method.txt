* Diffrence between == and .equals()
-In general, both equals() and “==” operator in Java are used to compare objects to check equality but here are some of the 
  differences between the two: 
1)The main difference between the .equals() method and == operator is that one is a method and the other is the operator.
2)We can use == operators for reference comparison (address comparison) and .equals() method for content comparison.
3) In simple words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location whereas .equals() evaluates to the comparison of values 
   in the objects.
4)If a class does not override the equals method, then by default it uses the equals(Object o) method of the closest parent class that
     has overridden this method.
5)coding Example
                 the concept of == operator
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String s1 = "HELLO";
        String s2 = "HELLO";
        String s3 =  new String("HELLO");
        System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true
        System.out.println(s1 == s3); // false
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
        System.out.println(s1.equals(s3)); // true
    }
}
