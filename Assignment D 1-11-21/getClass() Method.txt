* getClass() method:
1)getClass() is the method of Object class.
2)This method returns the runtime class of this object.
3)The class object which is returned is the object that is locked by static synchronized method of the represented class.
4)So, you can see that getClass() method put a restriction that objects are only equal to other objects of the same class, the same runtime type, 
   but instanceof operator returns true for subclass as well.
5)If you use the getClass() in the equals() method then it will only return true if the other object is also of the same class or same 
  runtime type, it will return false even if its object of subclass and follow the Liskov substitution principle. 
6)The biggest disadvantage of using getClass() in the equals() method is the fact that you get two objects that appear to be equal 
  (because they are equal on all the fields) but they are not equal because they are of different classes.

7)Syntax:  Following is the declaration for java.lang.Object.getClass() method
       
       public final Class getClass()
