* native Keyword in java :
1)The native keyword is applied to a method to indicate that the method is implemented in native code using JNI 
  (Java Native Interface).
2)native is a modifier applicable only for methods and we can't apply it anywhere else.
3)The main objective of native keyword are:

    -To improve performance of the system.
    -To achieve machine level/memory level communication.
    -To use already existing legacy non-java code.
4)For native methods implementation is already available in old languages like C, C++ and we are not responsible 
  to provide implementation.
5)Hence native method declaration should ends with ;( semi-colon). 
6)We canâ€™t declare native method as abstract.
7)The main advantage of native keyword is performance will be improved but the main disadvantage of native keyword 
  is it breaks platform independent nature of java.
